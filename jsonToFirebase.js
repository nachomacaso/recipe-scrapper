    "title": "Chicken Piccata Pasta Recipe",
    "description": "Chicken piccata gets the full pasta treatment! Cook the penne, make a quick butter sauce, and assemble it all together. This easy lemony chicken dish will wow your kids!",
    "prepTime": "15 minutes",
    "cookTime": "25 minutes",
    "yeild": "6 servings",
    "ingredients": "\n1 pound penne pasta\n3/4 cup all-purpose flour\n1 1/4 teaspoons salt\n1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n2 large eggs\n1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts, sliced into cutlets about 3/4-inch thick\n1/2 cup olive oil\n2 tablespoons butter\n1 small white onion, diced\n2 cloves garlic, sliced\n1/2 cup chicken stock\nJuice from 1 lemon (about 3 tablespoons of juice)\n1/4 cup capers\n1/4 cup fresh minced parsley\nSalt and pepper, to taste\n\n2 tablespoons butter\n2/3 cup Italian breadcrumbs\n1/4 teaspoon salt\n1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n",
    "directions": "1 Cook the pasta: Bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil, and add the pasta. Cook until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes or according to package instructions. Scoop out and reserve about 1/2 cup of the pasta-cooking water, and then drain the pasta. Set aside.\n2 Make the Dad Add – Buttered Breadcrumbs: In a small skillet, melt the butter over low heat. Add breadcrumbs and stir them well so they evenly soak up the butter.\nCook on low heat until the breadcrumbs start to brown, about 3 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent burning. Watch them closely, as they can go from perfect to burned quickly.\n\n3 Prep the chicken: Mix together the flour, salt, and pepper in a shallow bowl. Whisk the eggs in a second shallow bowl. Dip the chicken breasts first in the egg and then coat them with the flour mixture. They should have a very light coating on them. Let chicken rest on a plate.\n\n4 Fry the chicken: Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. When the oil sizzles immediately when you sprinkle a little flour in it, it's ready. Add the chicken pieces and cook for 4 to 5 minutes per side (8 to 10 minutes total). Check cooked chicken with a meat thermometer to make sure it reaches an internal temperature of 165°F.\nRemove chicken from the skillet, and let it rest while you finish the dish.\n\n5 Make the piccata sauce: Pour out all but about 2 tablespoons of the oil in the skillet, and add the 2 tablespoons butter. Turn the heat down to medium-low, and add onions and sliced garlic. Stir the veggies, cooking for a few minutes until they soften.\nAdd chicken stock and lemon juice, and using a wooden spoon, scrape up any bits stuck to the pan.\n\n6 Finish the dish: Add the cooked penne to the skillet. Toss the penne with the lemon butter sauce. If the pan seems dry, add enough of the reserved 1/2 cup pasta cooking water so the pasta no longer seems dry.\nAfter the chicken has cooled slightly, chop the skillet fried chicken into big chunks, and add back into the penne mixture. Garnish with fresh parsley and capers.\n\n7 Garnish and serve: Serve the penne while warm, topping each bowl with the crispy buttered Italian breadcrumbs.\nThis dish keeps great in the fridge for 3 to 4 days. If you can plan ahead on the portion you will keep for leftovers, it’s best to actually store the chicken and pasta separately. Otherwise, the chicken will get soggy. Reheat the chicken in a 350°F oven for about 8 minutes, and then chop and add to reheated penne pasta.\n\n\n                    ",

    "yeild": "Serves 3 to 4",
    "ingredients": "\n1 to 1 1/4 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts\nSalt\n2 tablespoons olive oil + more for lightly coating chicken\n1 tablespoon butter\n1 cup sliced shallots\n1/2 cup dry white wine (can sub chicken stock)\n1/2 cup water\n4 tablespoons Dijon mustard, smooth, whole grain, or a mixture of both\n1 teaspoon dried thyme\n1/4 cup heavy cream\n",
    "directions": "1 Cut chicken breasts and pound thin: Remove chicken breasts from package and sprinkle with salt. Remove the tenderloin from each breast and set aside. Cut each chicken breast into 3 pieces, approximately the same size. Coat with just a little olive oil.\nPlace the breast pieces between two pieces of plastic wrap or parchment paper and use a mallet, empty wine bottle, or rolling pin to pound the chicken pieces to an even thinness of about 1/4 inch. Repeat with the tenderloin pieces.\n\n2 Lightly brown the chicken cutlets: In a large, heavy-bottomed sauté pan, heat the olive oil on medium high to high heat. Stir in the butter. When the butter is foamy, add the chicken pieces to the pan. Do not crowd the pan, if necessary work in batches.\nLightly brown chicken on one side, turn over and brown the other side. Do not overcook the chicken. The pieces are thin and they will cook quickly. Remove the chicken pieces from the pan and set aside while you make the sauce.\n \n3 Cook the shallots: Add sliced shallots to the pan. Lower the heat to medium. Stir to coat with the remaining fat in the pan. Cook until softened, about 5 to 6 minutes.\n \n4 Make the sauce: Add white wine to the pan and increase the heat to high. When most of the wine has evaporated, add the water, the mustard, and the dried thyme. Simmer until reduced by half.\n \n5 Add chicken back to pan, drizzle in cream: Reduce the heat to low. Add the chicken back to the pan and coat with the sauce. Remove the pan from heat and drizzle in the cream. Taste and adjust seasonings, adding more salt if necessary.\n \n6 Serve: Serve with egg noodles, rice, mashed potatoes, puréed celery root or parsnips, or serve alone or with vegetables for low carb version.\n\n                    ",

    "title": "The Best Dry Brined Roast Chicken Recipe",
    "description": "Dry-brined roasted chickens are the best way to get succulent, juicy meat, and crispy, golden skin! The best part? You only need 5 minutes and some space in the fridge! ",
    "prepTime": "5 minutes",
    "cookTime": "1 hour, 20 minutes",
    "yeild": "Serves 4 ",
    "ingredients": "\n1 5- to 6-pound chicken\n1 lemon\n2 tablespoons olive oil\n2 3/4 teaspoons kosher salt\n1 1/4 teaspoons freshly cracked pepper\n1 1/4 teaspoons dried thyme\n",
    "directions": "1 Prepare the pan: Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil and set a baking rack on top or use a roasting pan with a roasting rack.\n2 Make the spice rub: Zest and quarter the lemon. Combine the lemon zest, juice from 1/4 of the lemon, 1 tablespoon olive oil, 2 1/2 teaspoons salt, pepper and thyme together in a small bowl.\nSave the lemon quarters (even the one you squeezed dry) to insert into the cavity.\n3 Season the chicken: Pat the outside of the chicken dry with a paper towel. Slide your fingers between the skin and the breast meat to loosen the skin. Try to separate the skin from around the legs as well.\nRub 3/4 of the spice mixture under the skin and into the breast and leg meat. Rub the remaining spice mixture inside the cavity of the bird. Insert the lemon quarters in the cavity.\n \n4 Truss the chicken: To truss the chicken, cut a piece of kitchen twine about 15 inches long. Tuck the wings under the bird as best you can. Center the twine under the back end of the chicken so equal lengths of twine are where you tucked the wings in.\nLift up each side of the twine crossing it over the top of bird’s body, wrap it around the legs. Tie the legs together.\n  \n5 Let the chicken air dry for 24 hours: Place the bird, baking sheet and all, into your refrigerator uncovered for 24 to 72 hours. If you don’t have the room in your refrigerator it’s ok to put the chicken on a plate and transfer it to the baking sheet when you’re ready to roast the bird.\n\n6 Prepare the oven: When ready to roast, move your oven rack to the second lowest spot in the oven. Preheat the oven to 375° F degrees.\n7 Add extra seasonings: The chicken will look a little desiccated after the 24-72 hour rest. That’s a good thing! It means your chicken will have crispy skin!\nTransfer the baking sheet from the fridge to the counter. Rub the outside of the chicken with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, a 1/4 teaspoon of kosher salt, and a few cracks of fresh ground pepper.\n\n8 Roast and baste the chicken: Place the baking sheet into the oven and roast for 1 hour at 375° F degrees. Then turn the oven up to 425° F degrees for the remaining 20 minutes or until the temperature in the thickest part of the breast reaches 160° F degrees.\nCheck the chicken at the 45-minute mark and baste it. You may have to tip the pan a little to the corner to get to the juices. If you don’t have a baster don’t worry, just use a long-handled spoon to scoop up and pour the drippings over the chicken.\nContinue to baste every 15 to 20 minutes until it reaches a deep, rich, golden color, the skin is crispy, and the chicken has finished cooking through.\n\n9 Rest the chicken: Remove the chicken from the oven when the temperature in the thickest part of the breast reads about 160°F. Let it rest for 5 minutes. The temperature will continue to rise to reach 165°F.\nIf you don’t have a thermometer that’s ok. The chicken is cooked through when you slice into it and the juices run clear.\n\n\n                    ",

    "directions": "1 Make the matzo ball mixture: Make the matzo ball mixture: In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, schmaltz, water, salt, and pepper. Stir in the matzo meal. Cover the bowl tightly and chill it in the fridge for at least two hours, or up to a day ahead.\n \n2 Shape and cook the matzo balls: In a large saucepan or soup pot, bring 3 quarts of water and 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt to a boil. When the water is boiling, turn the heat down to medium-low.\nUse your hands to roll the matzo ball mixture into approximately 1-inch balls. As you finish rolling each ball, gently drop it into the simmering water.\nWhen all of the matzo balls are in the water, immediately cover the pot and reduce the heat to low. Let the matzo balls simmer, covered, for 40 minutes, until they have floated to the top and roughly doubled in size. Avoid uncovering the pot while the matzo balls are cooking (a covered pot helps the matzo balls cook more evenly and quickly).\n  \n3 Warm the broth and vegetables: While the matzo balls are simmering, bring the chicken broth up to a simmer in a medium (3-quart) saucepan over medium heat. Add the sliced carrots and celery and reduce the heat to low.\nSimmer the vegetables in the broth until they’re tender, about 5 minutes. Turn off the heat and keep the broth covered so it stays hot while the matzo balls finish cooking.\n \n4 Serve the soup: Use a slotted spoon to transfer three matzo balls into each soup bowl, then ladle 1 1/2 cups of broth into each bowl. Garnish each bowl with a sprinkle of parsley or dill and a few grinds of black pepper. Serve piping hot.\n\n                    ",

    "directions": "1 Preheat oven to 400°F. Heat olive oil in a 12-inch oven-safe skillet over medium heat. \n2 Bread the chicken: Prepare your breading stations by stirring the salt and pepper with the flour in one bowl, whisking the egg in a second bowl, and measuring breadcrumbs and Parmesan cheese into a third bowl. Coat chicken cutlets with seasoned flour. Dust off any extra flour.\nTransfer chicken cutlets to egg mixture and coat. Then transfer to the breadcrumbs and coat. Place breaded chicken on a plate.\n \n3 Fry the chicken: You'll know the oil is ready when a few breadcrumbs sizzle immediately when added to the oil (325°F). Add breaded chicken cutlets and fry for 4 minutes per side. The chicken should be 90 percent cooked through at this point; it should not be 100 percent cooked through. (Just a note though: You may need to fry in batches; if the pan gets overcrowded the chicken may not crisp up to your liking.)\nRemove chicken from the skillet, and carefully pour the olive oil into a bowl to cool, leaving about a tablespoon in the skillet. Don’t rinse out the skillet.\n\n4 Make the sauce: Add the onion and garlic to skillet and cook over medium-low heat for 2 minutes, until onion is translucent. Add the marinara sauce and bring to a low simmer.\n5 Finish the chicken Parm: Add the chicken back to the skillet in the sauce. Top each chicken piece with a slice of mozzarella cheese.\nPlace the skillet in the oven and bake for 10 to 12 minutes until the sauce is bubbling, the cheese is melted, and the chicken registers 165°F in the thickest parts.\n\n6 Serve: Serve chicken Parmesan immediately over pasta, rice, or even with bread and a salad. Garnish with red pepper flakes and fresh basil.\n\nLEFTOVERS! Leftover chicken Parmesan can be stored in the fridge for 4 to 5 days once it has cooled. For best results, reheat chicken Parm in a 325° F oven with some of the sauce until the cheese is re-melted.\n\n                    ",

Select the “Manual” or “Pressure Cook” program, then set the time to 30 minutes to an hour at high pressure. (30 minutes gives you a cleaner-tasting stock; 1 hour gives you a darker stock with a stronger flavor. When in doubt, go 45 minutes.)\nThe pot will take about 20 minutes to come up to pressure, and then the cook time will begin.

Smoosh the chicken around so it’s coated in the marinade.\n\n4 Lay the chicken flat in the freezer and freeze for up to 6 months.\nAlternatively, you could skip the freezer and let it marinade in the fridge for a couple of hours, or up to two days, and then cook it according to the directions below.\n \n5 Thaw the chicken before cooking: When ready to cook, take the chicken out of the freezer in the morning before you go to work, and it will be ready to cook by the end of the day.\n6 To prepare the vegetables: Trim the beans, slice the pepper into 1-inch strips, and dice the onion.\n\n7 Cook the chicken and vegetables: Set a large skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken and any marinade left in the bag. If any chicken is folded up, unfold it so it lays flat in the pan.\nAfter 2 minutes, flip the chicken, and add the green beans, sliced pepper, onion, and 3 tablespoons of water. Cover and cook for 10 more minutes.\nLift the lid and check the chicken by slicing open a piece. If the juices run clear, the chicken is done. Remove the chicken from the pan to a plate (leaving the vegetables in the pan) and tent with foil to keep warm.\n\n8 Finish cooking the vegetables: Add soy sauce and a few cracks of freshly ground pepper to the vegetables. Gently stir the vegetables.\nCover and cook until the peppers are tender, and the beans are bright green but firm tender, about 5 more minutes.\n9 Serve: Nestle the chicken back into the pan and garnish with additional orange zest if you have it. Bring the skillet to the table and serve.\n\n                    ",

    "title": "Chicken and Dumplings Recipe",
    "description": "Here's how to make classic chicken and dumplings! Start with a hearty chicken and vegetable stew, then adding delicious homemade dumplings. Learn the trick to light and fluffy homemade dumplings that still hold together.",
    "prepTime": "15 minutes",
    "cookTime": "45 minutes",
    "yeild": "Serves 6 to 8",
    "ingredients": "\n3 to 3  1/2 pounds chicken thighs and breast parts, skin-on, bone-in, trimmed of excess fat\n2 teaspoons butter or olive oil, or a combination of both\nSalt\n1 quart chicken stock (homemade is best)\n2 to 3 celery stalks, trimmed and cut into 1/2-inch pieces (about 2 cups)\n3 medium carrots, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces (about 2 cups)\n1 large onion, roughly chopped (about 2 cups)\n1/3 cup all-purpose flour\n1 teaspoon dried thyme\n1/4 cup dry sherry or vermouth (optional)\n1 Tbsp heavy cream (optional)\n3/4 cup frozen peas, thawed\n1/4 cup minced fresh parsley leaves\nGround black or white pepper\n\n2 cups (250 g) cake flour (can sub all-purpose flour, but use cake flour if you have it, your dumplings will be fluffier)\n2 teaspoons baking powder\n3/4 teaspoon salt\n2 Tbsp butter, melted\n3/4 cup milk\n1/4 cup minced fresh herb leaves such as parsley, chives, and tarragon (optional)\n",
    "directions": "1 Heat the chicken stock to a gentle simmer in a medium pot.\n2 Brown the chicken: In a large 8-quart or larger thick-bottomed pot, heat the butter or olive oil over medium-high heat. Pat dry the chicken pieces and sprinkle with salt.\nWorking in batches, brown the chicken pieces, placing the pieces skin-side down first; this will render out fat you will use to build the stew later.\n \n3 Poach the chicken in the stock: Once the chicken pieces are browned on all sides, remove them from the large pot, and turn off the heat. Remove and discard the skin from the chicken pieces and put the chicken pieces into the pot of simmering stock.\nPoach the chicken in the stock until cooked through, about 20 minutes or so.\nRemove the chicken pieces and set on a tray to cool for a few minutes. When the chicken pieces are cool to touch, pull the meat off the bones and cut into 2-inch chunks. Set aside.\n4 Cook the vegetables until softened: Return the heat on the large pot to medium-high. When the pot is hot, add the onion, celery, carrot and thyme and sauté until soft, but not browned, about 4 to 5 minutes.\n\n5 Add the flour and stir well. The flour will absorb the fat in the pot and will stick a little to the bottom. Reduce the heat to medium-low and stir the flour vegetable mixture constantly for 2 to 3 minutes. Do not let it burn.\n \n6 Add sherry, slowly add stock: Get a ladle ready and have the pot of simmering chicken stock nearby. Add the sherry to the flour vegetable mixture. It will sputter and seize up.\nAdd a ladle of hot chicken stock to and stir well. It will be goopy. Add another ladle, then another, stirring all the while, until the broth comes together.\n\nAdd the rest of the chicken stock and the reserved chicken meat. Increase the heat and bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat to maintain a gentle simmer while you make the dumplings.\n7 Make the dumpling batter: Whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl. Add (optional) chopped fresh herbs. Add melted butter and milk to the dry ingredients.\nGently mix with a wooden spoon until mixture just comes together. (Note: do not over-mix or your dumplings will turn out too dense.)\n \n8 Add dumplings to the stew: Drop dumpling batter into the simmering stew by heaping teaspoonfuls, over the surface of the stew. (Note that the dumplings will easily double in size as they cook.) Cover and simmer until dumplings are cooked through, about 15 minutes.\n \nOnce you have covered the pan, do not uncover and peek while the dumplings are cooking! In order for the dumplings to be light and fluffy, they must steam, not boil. Uncovering the pan releases the steam.\nIf after 15 minutes the dumplings are still not cooked through (use a toothpick or skewer to test), then cover pan again and cook for another 5 to 10 minutes.\n9 Finish the stew: Gently stir in peas, parsley, and cream, if using. Add more salt to taste. Ladle portions of meat, sauce, vegetables, and dumplings into soup plates and serve. Note that the stew will continue to thicken the longer it sits.\n \n\n                    ",

Broil for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the chicken and vegetables are lightly charred.\n\n7 Warm the tortillas: Set a dry skillet over medium heat and heat until hot. Lay one tortilla at a time on the hot pan and turn, as above. Use 2 pans or a pancake griddle if you want to heat more than one at time.\nAlternately, you can place a tortilla (one at a time) directly over a gas burner on medium-low heat for about 20 seconds, or until it starts to puff slightly. With tongs, turn it over and let it heat for a few more seconds on the other side.\nThe microwave also works. Just wrap 1 to 3 tortillas in a damp paper towel and microwave for 30 seconds, or until hot.\nWrap the warm tortillas in a napkin and set them on a plate.\n8 Serve the fajitas: Transfer the chicken and vegetables to a warm platter. Bring the platter and the warm tortillas to the table for people to help themselves. Serve with lime wedges, cilantro, and avocado. If you like, you could serve with rice and beans, too.\n\n\n                    ",

Using your hands, a rolling pin, a mallet, or the hands of your children, crush the Goldfish as much as you can, but don't turn them into flour. You want some inconsistencies in shape; it'll make for better texture.\n\n3 Prep the assembly line: Find three medium bowls. Stir together the flour, salt, and pepper in one. Whisk the eggs together in the second bowl. Add the crushed Goldfish crackers to the last one.\n4 Bread the chicken: Working with a few pieces of chicken at a time, add to seasoned flour and coat well. Then shake off any extra flour, move to the eggs and coat well, and finally add to crushed Goldfish. Press the Goldfish on so they really stick and form a good crust.\nTransfer coated chicken to the baking sheet. Repeat until all the chicken tenders are coated.\n\n5 Bake the chicken: Bake chicken tenders for about 20 minutes until they are cooked through, or reach an internal temperature of 165°F in the thickest part of the tenders. You can also test one of the thicker ones by cutting it in half and making sure it’s cooked through.\nThere’s no need to flip these, but you can flip them halfway through if they are browning too much on one side.\nServe tenders while warm with a veggie and/or side salad and any dips you want, such as ketchup or bbq sauce.

Cut the olives in half.\n  \n6 Cook the chicken: Set a large skillet over medium heat add 2 teaspoons of olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter. Once the oil shimmers and the butter melts, add the chicken and any marinade in the bag.\nIf any chicken is folded up, unfold it so it lays flat in the pan. Cook the chicken for 2 minutes, then flip it.\n\n7 Add the vegetables: Add the potatoes, onion, and 1/4 cup water to the pan with the chicken. Cover with a lid. Let everything simmer together for about 10 minutes.\n\n8 Finish the potatoes and make the sauce: Remove the chicken to a plate (leaving the vegetables in the skillet) and tent with foil. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter, 1/4 teaspoon of salt and a few cracks of freshly ground pepper to the skillet. Stir the potatoes, cover and cook for another 10 minutes.\nTurn the heat up to medium high to reduce the liquid and finish cooking the potatoes uncovered. This should take about 2 to 3 minutes depending on how much liquid is in the pan.\nWhen you can easily pierce the potatoes with a fork, add the chard leaves and chopped stems, olives, and red wine vinegar. Toss gently until the greens are just wilted.\n9 Serve: Nestle the chicken back into the pan. Bring the whole thing over to the table and serve.\n\n                    ",

    "yeild": "4 to 6 servings",
    "ingredients": "\n1 pound pizza dough, store-bought or homemade, room temperature (See Recipe Note)\n2 tablespoons olive oil\n2 cups cooked shredded chicken\n1 cup BBQ sauce, such as Hunt's Hickory BBQ Sauce\n6 ounces (about 1 1/2 cups) shredded mozzarella cheese, divided\n1/2 red onion, thinly sliced\n1 jalapeño, thinly sliced\n",
    "directions": "1 Preheat the oven to 450ºF. Place a rack in the lowest position.\n2 Stretch the dough onto the baking sheet: Place the dough in the center of the baking sheet and drizzle with the oil. Turn the dough to coat it well, spreading some of the oil over the baking sheet.\nGradually stretch the dough until it reaches the edges of the baking sheet, being careful not to rip any holes in the dough. If it springs back or is difficult to stretch, this usually means that the dough is too cold. To remedy the situation, cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 10 minutes before continuing.\n\n3 Top the pizza: Mix together the shredded chicken and barbecue sauce in a bowl, then spread evenly over the pizza dough, leaving a little bit of a border around the pizza.\nSprinkle evenly with two-thirds of the cheese, scatter the red onion and then the jalapeño, and then sprinkle with the remaining cheese. (I like to have cheese both under and over the toppings, but you can assemble it however you choose.)\n\n4 Bake the pizza: Set the pan on lowest shelf of the oven and bake until the cheese melts and the pizza is golden brown, about 15 minutes. Cut into squares and serve hot.\n\n\n                    ",

    "directions": "1 Slow cook the sausage, chicken, and veggies: Add the onion, celery, bell pepper, garlic, sausage, chicken, tomatoes, oregano, bay leaves, and Creole seasoning to a large slow cooker. Stir together well.\nCook on high for 3 hours or on low for 4 to 5 hours. You are ready to move onto the next step when the veggies are very tender and the chicken is cooked through and you can pull it easily apart.\n\n2 Add the shrimp and cook on high: Leave the shells on the shrimp, but use kitchen shears to cut up the backs; this will make them easier to peel later.\nAdd the shrimp to the slow cooker. Stir it in, cover, and cook on high for another 30 to 45 minutes until the shrimp are cooked through.\n3 Cook the rice: While the shrimp cooks, cook the rice either according to the package directions or following this boiled rice method. When done, set the rice aside, covered, until ready to serve. (This makes about 4 cups of cooked rice.)\n3 Taste and season: Remove bay leaves from the jambalaya and taste. Season with salt and pepper to taste and garnish with fresh chopped parsley. Either peel the shells off the shrimp now, or serve with the shells on and instruct guests to remove the shells as they eat.\nStir the cooked rice into the jambalaya (as pictured), or serve the jambalaya ladled over top the rice.\nLeftovers will keep in the fridge in air-tight containers for 2 to 3 days and then the shrimp start to really break down. This dish doesn’t freeze particularly well. The combination of rice, shrimp, and sauce doesn’t reheat easily without making the shrimp very rubbery.\n\n\n                    ",

    "ingredients": "\n1 pound penne pasta\n3/4 cup all-purpose flour\n1 1/4 teaspoons salt\n1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n2 large eggs\n1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts, sliced into cutlets about 3/4-inch thick\n1/2 cup olive oil\n2 tablespoons butter\n1 small white onion, diced\n2 cloves garlic, sliced\n1/2 cup chicken stock\nJuice from 1 lemon (about 3 tablespoons of juice)\n1/4 cup capers\n1/4 cup fresh minced parsley\nSalt and pepper, to taste\n\n2 tablespoons butter\n2/3 cup Italian breadcrumbs\n1/4 teaspoon salt\n1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n",
    "directions": "1 Cook the pasta: Bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil, and add the pasta. Cook until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes or according to package instructions. Scoop out and reserve about 1/2 cup of the pasta-cooking water, and then drain the pasta. Set aside.\n2 Make the Dad Add – Buttered Breadcrumbs: In a small skillet, melt the butter over low heat. Add breadcrumbs and stir them well so they evenly soak up the butter.\nCook on low heat until the breadcrumbs start to brown, about 3 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent burning. Watch them closely, as they can go from perfect to burned quickly.\n\n3 Prep the chicken: Mix together the flour, salt, and pepper in a shallow bowl. Whisk the eggs in a second shallow bowl. Dip the chicken breasts first in the egg and then coat them with the flour mixture. They should have a very light coating on them. Let chicken rest on a plate.\n\n4 Fry the chicken: Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. When the oil sizzles immediately when you sprinkle a little flour in it, it's ready. Add the chicken pieces and cook for 4 to 5 minutes per side (8 to 10 minutes total). Check cooked chicken with a meat thermometer to make sure it reaches an internal temperature of 165°F.\nRemove chicken from the skillet, and let it rest while you finish the dish.\n\n5 Make the piccata sauce: Pour out all but about 2 tablespoons of the oil in the skillet, and add the 2 tablespoons butter. Turn the heat down to medium-low, and add onions and sliced garlic. Stir the veggies, cooking for a few minutes until they soften.\nAdd chicken stock and lemon juice, and using a wooden spoon, scrape up any bits stuck to the pan.\n\n6 Finish the dish: Add the cooked penne to the skillet. Toss the penne with the lemon butter sauce. If the pan seems dry, add enough of the reserved 1/2 cup pasta cooking water so the pasta no longer seems dry.\nAfter the chicken has cooled slightly, chop the skillet fried chicken into big chunks, and add back into the penne mixture. Garnish with fresh parsley and capers.\n\n7 Garnish and serve: Serve the penne while warm, topping each bowl with the crispy buttered Italian breadcrumbs.\nThis dish keeps great in the fridge for 3 to 4 days. If you can plan ahead on the portion you will keep for leftovers, it’s best to actually store the chicken and pasta separately. Otherwise, the chicken will get soggy. Reheat the chicken in a 350°F oven for about 8 minutes, and then chop and add to reheated penne pasta.\n\n\n                    ",

    "directions": "1 Cut chicken breasts and pound thin: Remove chicken breasts from package and sprinkle with salt. Remove the tenderloin from each breast and set aside. Cut each chicken breast into 3 pieces, approximately the same size. Coat with just a little olive oil.\nPlace the breast pieces between two pieces of plastic wrap or parchment paper and use a mallet, empty wine bottle, or rolling pin to pound the chicken pieces to an even thinness of about 1/4 inch. Repeat with the tenderloin pieces.\n\n2 Lightly brown the chicken cutlets: In a large, heavy-bottomed sauté pan, heat the olive oil on medium high to high heat. Stir in the butter. When the butter is foamy, add the chicken pieces to the pan. Do not crowd the pan, if necessary work in batches.\nLightly brown chicken on one side, turn over and brown the other side. Do not overcook the chicken. The pieces are thin and they will cook quickly. Remove the chicken pieces from the pan and set aside while you make the sauce.\n \n3 Cook the shallots: Add sliced shallots to the pan. Lower the heat to medium. Stir to coat with the remaining fat in the pan. Cook until softened, about 5 to 6 minutes.\n \n4 Make the sauce: Add white wine to the pan and increase the heat to high. When most of the wine has evaporated, add the water, the mustard, and the dried thyme. Simmer until reduced by half.\n \n5 Add chicken back to pan, drizzle in cream: Reduce the heat to low. Add the chicken back to the pan and coat with the sauce. Remove the pan from heat and drizzle in the cream.

Combine the lemon zest, juice from 1/4 of the lemon, 1 tablespoon olive oil, 2 1/2 teaspoons salt, pepper and thyme together in a small bowl.\nSave the lemon quarters (even the one you squeezed dry) to insert into the cavity.\n3 Season the chicken: Pat the outside of the chicken dry with a paper towel. Slide your fingers between the skin and the breast meat to loosen the skin. Try to separate the skin from around the legs as well.\nRub 3/4 of the spice mixture under the skin and into the breast and leg meat. Rub the remaining spice mixture inside the cavity of the bird. Insert the lemon quarters in the cavity.\n \n4 Truss the chicken: To truss the chicken, cut a piece of kitchen twine about 15 inches long. Tuck the wings under the bird as best you can. Center the twine under the back end of the chicken so equal lengths of twine are where you tucked the wings in.\nLift up each side of the twine crossing it over the top of bird’s body, wrap it around the legs. Tie the legs together.\n  \n5 Let the chicken air dry for 24 hours: Place the bird, baking sheet and all, into your refrigerator uncovered for 24 to 72 hours. If you don’t have the room in your refrigerator it’s ok to put the chicken on a plate and transfer it to the baking sheet when you’re ready to roast the bird.\n\n6 Prepare the oven: When ready to roast, move your oven rack to the second lowest spot in the oven. Preheat the oven to 375° F degrees.\n7 Add extra seasonings: The chicken will look a little desiccated after the 24-72 hour rest. That’s a good thing! It means your chicken will have crispy skin!\nTransfer the baking sheet from the fridge to the counter. Rub the outside of the chicken with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, a 1/4 teaspoon of kosher salt, and a few cracks of fresh ground pepper.\n\n8 Roast and baste the chicken: Place the baking sheet into the oven and roast for 1 hour at 375° F degrees. Then turn the oven up to 425° F degrees for the remaining 20 minutes or until the temperature in the thickest part of the breast reaches 160° F degrees.\nCheck the chicken at the 45-minute mark and baste it. You may have to tip the pan a little to the corner to get to the juices. If you don’t have a baster don’t worry, just use a long-handled spoon to scoop up and pour the drippings over the chicken.\nContinue to baste every 15 to 20 minutes until it reaches a deep, rich, golden color, the skin is crispy, and the chicken has finished cooking through.\n\n9 Rest the chicken: Remove the chicken from the oven when the temperature in the thickest part of the breast reads about 160°F. Let it rest for 5 minutes. The temperature will continue to rise to reach 165°F.\nIf you don’t have a thermometer that’s ok. The chicken is cooked through when you slice into it and the juices run clear.\n\n\n                    ",

    "directions": "1 Make the matzo ball mixture: Make the matzo ball mixture: In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, schmaltz, water, salt, and pepper. Stir in the matzo meal. Cover the bowl tightly and chill it in the fridge for at least two hours, or up to a day ahead.\n \n2 Shape and cook the matzo balls: In a large saucepan or soup pot, bring 3 quarts of water and 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt to a boil. When the water is boiling, turn the heat down to medium-low.\nUse your hands to roll the matzo ball mixture into approximately 1-inch balls. As you finish rolling each ball, gently drop it into the simmering water.\nWhen all of the matzo balls are in the water, immediately cover the pot and reduce the heat to low. Let the matzo balls simmer, covered, for 40 minutes, until they have floated to the top and roughly doubled in size. Avoid uncovering the pot while the matzo balls are cooking (a covered pot helps the matzo balls cook more evenly and quickly).\n  \n3 Warm the broth and vegetables: While the matzo balls are simmering, bring the chicken broth up to a simmer in a medium (3-quart) saucepan over medium heat. Add the sliced carrots and celery and reduce the heat to low.\nSimmer the vegetables in the broth until they’re tender, about 5 minutes. Turn off the heat and keep the broth covered so it stays hot while the matzo balls finish cooking.\n \n4 Serve the soup: Use a slotted spoon to transfer three matzo balls into each soup bowl, then ladle 1 1/2 cups of broth into each bowl. Garnish each bowl with a sprinkle of parsley or dill and a few grinds of black pepper. Serve piping hot.\n\n                    ",

    "prepTime": "10 minutes",
    "cookTime": "30 minutes",
    "yeild": "4 servings",
    "ingredients": "\n1 teaspoon salt\n1 teaspoon black pepper\n1 cup all-purpose flour\n1 large egg\n1 cup Italian breadcrumbs\n1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese\n1 1/2 to 2 pounds chicken cutlets\n1 cup olive oil\n1/2 cup diced onion\n2 cloves garlic, sliced\n2 cups marinara tomato sauce, homemade or store-bought\n6 ounces mozzarella cheese, sliced\nFresh basil, garnish\nRed pepper flakes, garnish\nCooked spaghetti or rice, for serving\n12-inch oven-safe cast iron or stainless steel skillet",
    "directions": "1 Preheat oven to 400°F. Heat olive oil in a 12-inch oven-safe skillet over medium heat. \n2 Bread the chicken: Prepare your breading stations by stirring the salt and pepper with the flour in one bowl, whisking the egg in a second bowl, and measuring breadcrumbs and Parmesan cheese into a third bowl. Coat chicken cutlets with seasoned flour. Dust off any extra flour.\nTransfer chicken cutlets to egg mixture and coat. Then transfer to the breadcrumbs and coat. Place breaded chicken on a plate.\n \n3 Fry the chicken: You'll know the oil is ready when a few breadcrumbs sizzle immediately when added to the oil (325°F). Add breaded chicken cutlets and fry for 4 minutes per side. The chicken should be 90 percent cooked through at this point; it should not be 100 percent cooked through. (Just a note though: You may need to fry in batches; if the pan gets overcrowded the chicken may not crisp up to your liking.)\nRemove chicken from the skillet, and carefully pour the olive oil into a bowl to cool, leaving about a tablespoon in the skillet. Don’t rinse out the skillet.\n\n4 Make the sauce: Add the onion and garlic to skillet and cook over medium-low heat for 2 minutes, until onion is translucent. Add the marinara sauce and bring to a low simmer.\n5 Finish the chicken Parm: Add the chicken back to the skillet in the sauce. Top each chicken piece with a slice of mozzarella cheese.\nPlace the skillet in the oven and bake for 10 to 12 minutes until the sauce is bubbling, the cheese is melted, and the chicken registers 165°F in the thickest parts.\n\n6 Serve: Serve chicken Parmesan immediately over pasta, rice, or even with bread and a salad. Garnish with red pepper flakes and fresh basil.\n\nLEFTOVERS! Leftover chicken Parmesan can be stored in the fridge for 4 to 5 days once it has cooled. For best results, reheat chicken Parm in a 325° F oven with some of the sauce until the cheese is re-melted.\n\n                    ",

    "description": "Chicken, lemongrass, and sweet potatoes on their own are pretty great, but when simmered in coconut milk and topped with chopped cilantro, they become pure magic in this Vietnamese Curry. ",
    "prepTime": "15 minutes",
    "cookTime": "40 minutes",
    "yeild": "4 to 6 servings",
    "ingredients": "\n1/2 cup coarsely chopped lemongrass, from 2 medium stalks\n2 tablespoons coarsely chopped peeled ginger\n1 medium yellow onion, coarsely chopped\n2 tablespoons Madras-style curry powder, preferably Sun brand\n1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, optional\n1 (13.5-ounce) can full-fat, unsweetened coconut milk, not shaken\n2 tablespoons virgin coconut oil or neutral oil, such as canola\n4 large boneless, skinless chicken thighs (about 1 3/4 pounds total), each cut into 3 pieces\n1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt\n1 1/4 pounds sweet potatoes (white or orange flesh), peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks\n3 to 5 fresh cilantro sprigs, coarsely chopped\n",
    "directions": "1 Make the curry paste: In a food processor, whirl the lemongrass into a fine texture, about 3 minutes, pausing occasionally to scrape down the bowl. Add the ginger and pulse to finely chop. Add the onion and pulse again to chop.\nAdd the curry powder, black pepper, and cayenne (if using) and whirl until you have a fragrant yellow paste, about 30 seconds.\n\n2 Prep the coconut milk: Do not shake the can of coconut milk. Open the can and remove 1/3 cup of the thick cream at the top of the coconut milk. Stir the remaining lighter milk, and set both aside.\n\n3 Begin cooking the curry: In a 3- to 4-quart pot over medium-high heat, melt the coconut oil. Add the lemongrass paste and cook for 3 to 5 minutes, stirring frequently, until fragrant and no longer raw and harsh smelling. Lower the heat as needed to avoid scorching.\nAdd the chicken and 1/2 teaspoon salt, stir to combine, and cook for 1 minute to meld the flavors. Add the coconut milk and a little water to cover the chicken. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, cover, and adjust the heat to gently simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.\n \n4 Add the sweet potatoes: Uncover the pot, add the sweet potatoes, and return the curry to a simmer. Continue cooking for 10 to 12 minutes, uncovered and stirring occasionally, until the potatoes are tender.\n\n5 Finish the curry: Turn off the heat, stir the coconut cream into the sauce, and let rest on the burner’s receding heat for 10 minutes, uncovered, to blend and mature flavors. Taste and season with salt (unsalted curry powder may require an additional teaspoon), and splash in a bit of water if the flavors are too strong.\nServe immediately, garnished with the cilantro.\n\n                    ",

    "cookTime": "1 hour, 5 minutes",
    "yeild": "Varies, but usually 1 to 2 quarts",
    "ingredients": "\n1 chicken carcass (from a cooked 2- to 3-pound chicken), or 1 pound bones\n1 onion, halved or quartered, optional\n1 rib celery, roughly chopped, optional\n1 carrot, peeled and roughly chopped, optional\n1 bay leaf\n1 to 2 quarts water, enough to cover\n6- or 8-quart electric pressure cooker",
    "directions": "1 Add the bones and vegetables to the pressure cooker: Put the chicken bones and vegetables (if using) in your pressure cooker. Add water to almost come level with the bones, making sure not to fill the cooker more than 2/3 full. Remember, your cooker can’t come to pressure if it is too full.\n\n2 Bring the pot up to pressure: Place the lid on the pressure cooker. Make sure the valve is set to the “Sealing” position. Select the “Manual” or “Pressure Cook” program, then set the time to 30 minutes to an hour at high pressure. (30 minutes gives you a cleaner-tasting stock; 1 hour gives you a darker stock with a stronger flavor. When in doubt, go 45 minutes.)\nThe pot will take about 20 minutes to come up to pressure, and then the cook time will begin. (Frozen bones will take longer to come to pressure.)\n\n3 Let the pressure release naturally. This can take up to 30 minutes.\n4 Strain the stock: Strain the stock through a fine-mesh strainer into a stockpot or large bowl. Either skim off the fat and use the stock immediately, or let cool to room temperature before refrigerating.\n\n5 Store or freeze: Stock will keep in the refrigerator for up to a week, or transfer to freezer containers and freeze for up to a year.\n\n                    ",

    "prepTime": "15 minutes",
    "cookTime": "45 minutes",
    "yeild": "Serves 6 to 8",
    "ingredients": "\n3 to 3  1/2 pounds chicken thighs and breast parts, skin-on, bone-in, trimmed of excess fat\n2 teaspoons butter or olive oil, or a combination of both\nSalt\n1 quart chicken stock (homemade is best)\n2 to 3 celery stalks, trimmed and cut into 1/2-inch pieces (about 2 cups)\n3 medium carrots, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces (about 2 cups)\n1 large onion, roughly chopped (about 2 cups)\n1/3 cup all-purpose flour\n1 teaspoon dried thyme\n1/4 cup dry sherry or vermouth (optional)\n1 Tbsp heavy cream (optional)\n3/4 cup frozen peas, thawed\n1/4 cup minced fresh parsley leaves\nGround black or white pepper\n\n2 cups (250 g) cake flour (can sub all-purpose flour, but use cake flour if you have it, your dumplings will be fluffier)\n2 teaspoons baking powder\n3/4 teaspoon salt\n2 Tbsp butter, melted\n3/4 cup milk\n1/4 cup minced fresh herb leaves such as parsley, chives, and tarragon (optional)\n",
    "directions": "1 Heat the chicken stock to a gentle simmer in a medium pot.\n2 Brown the chicken: In a large 8-quart or larger thick-bottomed pot, heat the butter or olive oil over medium-high heat. Pat dry the chicken pieces and sprinkle with salt.\nWorking in batches, brown the chicken pieces, placing the pieces skin-side down first; this will render out fat you will use to build the stew later.\n \n3 Poach the chicken in the stock: Once the chicken pieces are browned on all sides, remove them from the large pot, and turn off the heat. Remove and discard the skin from the chicken pieces and put the chicken pieces into the pot of simmering stock.\nPoach the chicken in the stock until cooked through, about 20 minutes or so.\nRemove the chicken pieces and set on a tray to cool for a few minutes. When the chicken pieces are cool to touch, pull the meat off the bones and cut into 2-inch chunks. Set aside.\n4 Cook the vegetables until softened: Return the heat on the large pot to medium-high. When the pot is hot, add the onion, celery, carrot and thyme and sauté until soft, but not browned, about 4 to 5 minutes.\n\n5 Add the flour and stir well. The flour will absorb the fat in the pot and will stick a little to the bottom. Reduce the heat to medium-low and stir the flour vegetable mixture constantly for 2 to 3 minutes. Do not let it burn.\n \n6 Add sherry, slowly add stock: Get a ladle ready and have the pot of simmering chicken stock nearby. Add the sherry to the flour vegetable mixture. It will sputter and seize up.\nAdd a ladle of hot chicken stock to and stir well. It will be goopy. Add another ladle, then another, stirring all the while, until the broth comes together.\n\nAdd the rest of the chicken stock and the reserved chicken meat. Increase the heat and bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat to maintain a gentle simmer while you make the dumplings.\n7 Make the dumpling batter: Whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl. Add (optional) chopped fresh herbs. Add melted butter and milk to the dry ingredients.\nGently mix with a wooden spoon until mixture just comes together. (Note: do not over-mix or your dumplings will turn out too dense.)\n \n8 Add dumplings to the stew: Drop dumpling batter into the simmering stew by heaping teaspoonfuls, over the surface of the stew. (Note that the dumplings will easily double in size as they cook.) Cover and simmer until dumplings are cooked through, about 15 minutes.\n \nOnce you have covered the pan, do not uncover and peek while the dumplings are cooking! In order for the dumplings to be light and fluffy, they must steam, not boil. Uncovering the pan releases the steam.\nIf after 15 minutes the dumplings are still not cooked through (use a toothpick or skewer to test), then cover pan again and cook for another 5 to 10 minutes.\n9 Finish the stew: Gently stir in peas, parsley, and cream, if using. Add more salt to taste. Ladle portions of meat, sauce, vegetables, and dumplings into soup plates and serve. Note that the stew will continue to thicken the longer it sits.\n \n\n                    ",

Use 2 pans or a pancake griddle if you want to heat more than one at time.\nAlternately, you can place a tortilla (one at a time) directly over a gas burner on medium-low heat for about 20 seconds, or until it starts to puff slightly. With tongs, turn it over and let it heat for a few more seconds on the other side.\nThe microwave also works. Just wrap 1 to 3 tortillas in a damp paper towel and microwave for 30 seconds, or until hot.\nWrap the warm tortillas in a napkin and set them on a plate.\n8 Serve the fajitas: Transfer the chicken and vegetables to a warm platter. Bring the platter and the warm tortillas to the table for people to help themselves. Serve with lime wedges, cilantro, and avocado.

Use your hands to mold into a ball, then flatten the ball into a disk.\n \nSprinkle with a little flour, wrap with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 2 days, before rolling.\n3 Preheat oven to 400°F.\n4 Prepare the filling:  In a large skillet, melt butter on medium heat. Add the onions, carrots, and celery, and cook until the onions are translucent, about 10 minutes.\n\nAdd the flour and cook, stirring, one minute more.\nWhisk in 2 1/2 cups of the chicken stock. Whisk in the milk. Decrease the heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring often until thickened and creamy.\n\nAdd the chicken meat, thyme, sherry, peas, parsley, salt and pepper and stir well. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary. Divide the warm filling among six 10-ounce ramekins.\n \n4 Prepare the crust: Roll out dough on a lightly flour surface to a little less than a quarter-inch thick.\nCut into 6 rounds, slightly larger than the circumference of the ramekins. Lay a dough round on each pot pie filling.\nFold the excess dough under itself and use the tines of a fork to press the dough against the edge of the ramekins.\n\nCut a 1-inch vent into each individual pie. Use a pastry brush to apply an egg wash to each pie.\n5 Bake: Line a baking sheet with foil, place the pies on the baking sheet. Bake at 400°F for 25 minutes, or until the pastry is golden and the filling is bubbling.\nLet cool for at least 5 minutes before serving.\n\n                    ",

    "title": "Goldfish Chicken Tenders Recipe",
    "description": "Goldfish Chicken Tenders are the ultimate kid-friendly snack that meets the ultimate kid-friendly dinner! These tenders are baked in the oven to crispy perfection. But guess what? Adults love them, too. ",
    "prepTime": "15 minutes",
    "cookTime": "20 minutes",
    "yeild": "About 20 chicken tenders",
    "ingredients": "\nNonstick spray, for sheet pan\n2 cups Goldfish cheese crackers, well crushed\n1 cup all-purpose flour\n1 teaspoon salt\n1 teaspoon black pepper\n3 large eggs\n2 pounds chicken breast, sliced into strips about 2-inches long and 1/2-inch thick\n\n1 6-inch sub roll\n1 tablespoon mayonnaise\n1/2 cup shredded iceberg lettuce\n3 to 4 Goldfish chicken tenders\nPickled banana peppers\n",
    "directions": "1 Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line a baking sheet with foil and spray with nonstick spray (or brush with oil).\n2 Crush the crackers: Place the crackers in a zip-top plastic bag and seal it. Using your hands, a rolling pin, a mallet, or the hands of your children, crush the Goldfish as much as you can, but don't turn them into flour. You want some inconsistencies in shape; it'll make for better texture.\n\n3 Prep the assembly line: Find three medium bowls. Stir together the flour, salt, and pepper in one. Whisk the eggs together in the second bowl. Add the crushed Goldfish crackers to the last one.\n4 Bread the chicken: Working with a few pieces of chicken at a time, add to seasoned flour and coat well. Then shake off any extra flour, move to the eggs and coat well, and finally add to crushed Goldfish. Press the Goldfish on so they really stick and form a good crust.\nTransfer coated chicken to the baking sheet. Repeat until all the chicken tenders are coated.\n\n5 Bake the chicken: Bake chicken tenders for about 20 minutes until they are cooked through, or reach an internal temperature of 165°F in the thickest part of the tenders. You can also test one of the thicker ones by cutting it in half and making sure it’s cooked through.\nThere’s no need to flip these, but you can flip them halfway through if they are browning too much on one side.\nServe tenders while warm with a veggie and/or side salad and any dips you want, such as ketchup or bbq sauce. My kids loved honey! You can also make the Dad Add and have a sandwich!\n\nHow to Reheat Leftover Tenders\nYou will probably have leftovers, which will keep for 3 to 4 days in the fridge. They reheat perfectly, but they will get soggy if you reheat them in the microwave. Either reheat them gently in a nonstick skillet over low heat until warmed through, or put them on a baking sheet and reheat them until they’re crispy, 7 to 8 minutes.\n\n                    ",

    "yeild": "4 to 6",
    "ingredients": "\n1 1/2 pounds boneless skinless chicken tenders, tenderloin, or thinly sliced chicken breasts\n1 1/2 tablespoons herbes de Provence\n1 1/4 teaspoons Kosher salt\n1 teaspoon freshly ground pepper\nZest of one lemon\n1 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice\n3 cloves minced garlic\n2 tablespoons olive oil\n\n2 teaspoons olive oil\n3 tablespoons butter, divided\n1 1/2 pounds B-sized or baby potatoes\n1/2 yellow onion\n1/2 teaspoon Kosher salt\nA few cracks of freshly ground pepper\n2 handfuls (2 packed cups) Swiss chard or spinach\n1/3 cup halved pimento-stuffed Spanish olives\n1 teaspoon red wine vinegar\n",
    "directions": "1 Label the bag: Use a sharpie to write the date and title of the recipe on a gallon-sized zip top bag so you can easily find it on SimplyRecipes.com when you want to cook it. Alternatively, write the cooking instructions on the bag, and date it.\n\n2 Combine the ingredients: Roll down the opening of the bag a little just so you don’t accidently get raw chicken juices on the outside of the zip top. Add the chicken, spices, zest, lemon juice, garlic and olive oil.\nRemove as much air as possible and seal the bag. Smoosh the chicken around so it’s coated in the marinade.\n\n3 Lay the chicken flat in the freezer and freeze for up to 6 months:\nAlternatively, you could skip the freezer and let it marinade in the fridge for a couple of hours and up to two days, then cook it according to the directions below.\n 4 Thaw the chicken before cooking: When ready to cook, take the chicken out of the freezer in the morning before you go to work, and it will be ready to cook by the end of the day.\n5 Prepare the vegetables: If the b-sized potatoes are larger than a golf ball, quarter them; if they are smaller just half them. Slice the onion. Wash the Swiss chard, remove the stems and chop them. Then cut the leaves into strips about an inch thick. Cut the olives in half.\n  \n6 Cook the chicken: Set a large skillet over medium heat add 2 teaspoons of olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter. Once the oil shimmers and the butter melts, add the chicken and any marinade in the bag.\nIf any chicken is folded up, unfold it so it lays flat in the pan. Cook the chicken for 2 minutes, then flip it.\n\n7 Add the vegetables: Add the potatoes, onion, and 1/4 cup water to the pan with the chicken. Cover with a lid. Let everything simmer together for about 10 minutes.\n\n8 Finish the potatoes and make the sauce: Remove the chicken to a plate (leaving the vegetables in the skillet) and tent with foil. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter, 1/4 teaspoon of salt and a few cracks of freshly ground pepper to the skillet. Stir the potatoes, cover and cook for another 10 minutes.\nTurn the heat up to medium high to reduce the liquid and finish cooking the potatoes uncovered. This should take about 2 to 3 minutes depending on how much liquid is in the pan.\nWhen you can easily pierce the potatoes with a fork, add the chard leaves and chopped stems, olives, and red wine vinegar. Toss gently until the greens are just wilted.\n9 Serve: Nestle the chicken back into the pan. Bring the whole thing over to the table and serve.\n\n                    ",

    "prepTime": "15 minutes",
    "cookTime": "15 minutes",
    "yeild": "4 to 6 servings",
    "ingredients": "\n1 pound pizza dough, store-bought or homemade, room temperature (See Recipe Note)\n2 tablespoons olive oil\n2 cups cooked shredded chicken\n1 cup BBQ sauce, such as Hunt's Hickory BBQ Sauce\n6 ounces (about 1 1/2 cups) shredded mozzarella cheese, divided\n1/2 red onion, thinly sliced\n1 jalapeño, thinly sliced\n",
    "directions": "1 Preheat the oven to 450ºF. Place a rack in the lowest position.\n2 Stretch the dough onto the baking sheet: Place the dough in the center of the baking sheet and drizzle with the oil. Turn the dough to coat it well, spreading some of the oil over the baking sheet.\nGradually stretch the dough until it reaches the edges of the baking sheet, being careful not to rip any holes in the dough. If it springs back or is difficult to stretch, this usually means that the dough is too cold. To remedy the situation, cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 10 minutes before continuing.\n\n3 Top the pizza: Mix together the shredded chicken and barbecue sauce in a bowl, then spread evenly over the pizza dough, leaving a little bit of a border around the pizza.\nSprinkle evenly with two-thirds of the cheese, scatter the red onion and then the jalapeño, and then sprinkle with the remaining cheese. (I like to have cheese both under and over the toppings, but you can assemble it however you choose.)\n\n4 Bake the pizza: Set the pan on lowest shelf of the oven and bake until the cheese melts and the pizza is golden brown, about 15 minutes. Cut into squares and serve hot.\n\n\n                    ",

    "directions": "1 Slow cook the sausage, chicken, and veggies: Add the onion, celery, bell pepper, garlic, sausage, chicken, tomatoes, oregano, bay leaves, and Creole seasoning to a large slow cooker. Stir together well.\nCook on high for 3 hours or on low for 4 to 5 hours. You are ready to move onto the next step when the veggies are very tender and the chicken is cooked through and you can pull it easily apart.\n\n2 Add the shrimp and cook on high: Leave the shells on the shrimp, but use kitchen shears to cut up the backs; this will make them easier to peel later.\nAdd the shrimp to the slow cooker. Stir it in, cover, and cook on high for another 30 to 45 minutes until the shrimp are cooked through.\n3 Cook the rice: While the shrimp cooks, cook the rice either according to the package directions or following this boiled rice method. When done, set the rice aside, covered, until ready to serve. (This makes about 4 cups of cooked rice.)\n3 Taste and season: Remove bay leaves from the jambalaya and taste. Season with salt and pepper to taste and garnish with fresh chopped parsley. Either peel the shells off the shrimp now, or serve with the shells on and instruct guests to remove the shells as they eat.\nStir the cooked rice into the jambalaya (as pictured), or serve the jambalaya ladled over top the rice.\nLeftovers will keep in the fridge in air-tight containers for 2 to 3 days and then the shrimp start to really break down. This dish doesn’t freeze particularly well. The combination of rice, shrimp, and sauce doesn’t reheat easily without making the shrimp very rubbery.\n\n\n                    ",
